# Applications of Bayesian network models in predicting types of hematological malignancies

Implementation of Applications of Bayesian network models in predicting types of hematological malignancies [(paper)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24758-5#additional-information).

Student project for [bioinformatics 2 course](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/enbio2) at FER, Zagreb.

## Usage

Make sure you have python compiler installed on your computer before using this project.

Run the project simply in python editor or by double-clicking in file explorer so the output is generated in CMD.

## Output

For output you should recieve data about accuracy of our learned Bayesian network for each node removed. First it starts with estimating value at 'Effect' node which is the final node of the network which tells us the complete accuracy of the network. After that, it removes all nodes one by one and estimates the value in that particular node and compares it to beforehand-known values.
